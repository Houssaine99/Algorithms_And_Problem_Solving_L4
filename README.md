# Algorithms & Problem Solving - Level 4 Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to all 65 problems from the **[Algorithms & Problem Solving Level 4](https://programmingadvices.com/courses/enrolled/1890122)** course by ProgrammingAdvices.

## 📚 About This Course

Level 4 is an advanced problem-solving course that focuses on:
- **65 challenging programming problems**
- Advanced algorithmic thinking and clean code principles
- Divide & Conquer methodology at scale

This course is designed for programmers who have completed the previous levels and are ready to tackle high-volume, complex problem-solving with professional-level discipline.

## 🎯 Solution Approach

For each problem in this repository, I provide **two different implementations**:

1. **Instructor's Solution** - The official solution approach taught in the course
2. **My Solution** - My personal approach and implementation

This dual-solution structure allows for:
- Comparing different problem-solving strategies
- Understanding multiple valid approaches
- Learning from both perspectives
- Identifying optimization opportunities
